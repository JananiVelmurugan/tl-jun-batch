String - 1.0 
+ immutable - every immutable object is by default thread safe
+ synchronized - string can be accessed by a single thread at a time
+ thread safe -  performance is not recommended
ex: 
String name = "Test" --> literal(recommended - SCP)
name + "Leaf" (or) name.concat("Leaf")
"Test" , "TestLeaf" 
String name = new String("Test"); --> obj reference

StringBuffer - 1.0
+ mutable
+ synchronized - stringbuffer can be accessed by a single thread at a time
+ thread safe - performance is not recommended
ex:
StringBuffer sb = "Test"; (not possible)
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Test");
sb.append("Leaf")
"TestLeaf"

StringBuilder - 1.5
+ mutable
+ non-synchronized - stringbuilder can be accessed by multiple threads at a time
+ not thread safe  - performance will be good
StringBuilder sb = "Test"; (not possible)
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Test");
sb.append("Leaf")
"TestLeaf"

Exception
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
The use of exceptions to manage errors 
+ try -  enclose the code that might throw an exception
+ catch - enclose the code that handle an exception 
+ finally - always executes when the try block exits, it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code
+ throw
+ throws - declare an exception(checked/unchecked) 
Syntax:
 The throws clause comprises the throws keyword followed by a comma-separated list of all the exceptions thrown by that method.
 The clause goes after the method name and argument list and before the brace that defines the scope of the method
+ UserDefined Exception - Exception
+ Types  - 2 types
	+ Checked Exception (CompileTime)
		+ ex: CloneNotSupportedException, MalformedURLException
	+ Unchecked Exception (Runtime)
		+ ex: ArithmeticException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
+ Two ways to deal with the exception 
	+ declare - throws  
	+ handle - try,catch,finally
Rules
+ try must be followed by either catch or finally 
+ nested try is possible 
+ try with multiple catch blocks are possible 
spawn main thread - default thread
