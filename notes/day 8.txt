Java.lang General Classes
+ Wrapper Class
+ Math
+ Runtime - totalMem(),freeMem(),maxMem(),addShutdownHook(),gc(),exit()
	+ Every Java application has a single instance of class Runtime that allows the application to interface with the environment in which the application is running. The current runtime can be obtained from the getRuntime method.
	+ An application cannot create its own instance of this class.
+ System - mills(),nano(),getEnv(),in,out,arrayCopy()
	+ It cannot be instantiated.
	Among the facilities provided by the System class are standard input, standard output, and error output streams; access to externally defined properties and environment variables; a means of loading files and libraries; 
	and a utility method for quickly copying a portion of an array.
	ex: String - charArray() 
primitive type, array
