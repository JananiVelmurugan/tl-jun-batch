Varargs
+ to pass an arbitrary number of values to a method. 
+ when you don't know how many of a particular(specific) type of argument will be passed to the method. 
+ It's a shortcut to creating an array manually.
+ follow the type of the last parameter by an ellipsis (three dots, ...)

Enums - is a type 
+ create static final field 
+ create constant
+ An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. 
+ The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. 
ex: PaymentType - card,netbanking,wallet,foodcard
class is a Type
enum is a Type

Generics
+ Generics add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time. 
+ Allows a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.

toString()
+ Returns a string representation of the object.
+ In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. 
+ The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. 
+ It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
hashcode() & equals()
+ That it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, 
  which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
+ If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, 
  then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.

clone()
+ review or replay the state of the object 
+ ex: weather forecast, cricket prediction score, stock market 
+ copy - shallow copy, deep copy
+ shallow copy is possible
+ Cloneable Interface
+ marker interface
