Design Patterns
Prerequisite
+ core java

Book
+ GOF - Gang Of Four 

Introduction
+ well-proved solution for a specific problem 
Three categories
+ Creational - object 
+ Structural - class and object
+ Behavioral - method 

Scenario
+ create single instance 
+ instance created must be used outside the class 
Employee emp = new Employee();
emp - instances, reference variable, object 

Solution 
Singleton Design pattern (Creational) 
class Employee{
	private static Employee emp ;
	private Employee(){
	} 
	private static createInstance(){
		emp = new Employee();
}

Advantages
+ reusable 
+ flexible
+ maintainable
+ testable 
+ ideas captured 
+ transparent 

Disadvantages
+ doesn't provide any absolute solution 
+ idea(spec) not implementation 

When
+ SDLC - requirement analysis 
+ scenarios that can ease the problem solving 

History

+ 23 Design Patterns 

SOLID 
S - Single Responsibility
O - Open-Closed 
L - Liskov Substitution
I - Interface Segregation
D - Dependency Inversion 

Purpose 
+ object-oreinted way to apply the solution 
+ contribute to software solution development that are easy to debug, understand, refactor

Single Responsibility 
+ Every java class must perform a single responsibility/functionality 
+ multiple functionality - changes need to be done for the entire class 
+ easy to maintain  

Open-Closed 
+ modules like method, variables - open to extension but closed for modification 
+ add a new method but not modify the existing method

Liskov Substitution - extension of open-closed 
+ any child class must be always substitutabale for parent class 
+ any behaviour(methods) of the program should not be interrupted

Interface Seggregation - similar to single responsibility/functionality
+ larger interface must be split into smaller ones

Dependency Inversion 
+ use abstract class/interfaces rather than concrete(child) class 
+ decoupling code
