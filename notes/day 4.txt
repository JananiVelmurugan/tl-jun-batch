Methodoverloading
+ same method name
	+ N - number of param
	+ O - order of param 
	+ T - type of param 
	
+ Constructor - complex initialization
	+ special method with class name
	+ may/may not have param
	+ no return
+ Constructor Chaining 
this()- in same class call a cons from another cons
super() - call parent class cons from a child class cons

this - current class instance
super - super class instance

+ Arrays - store elemets that are fixed size of similar type 
	+ dynamic grow/shrink size an array is not possible
	+ dynamic array can be created inside loop
+ Inheritance - resuability
	+ parent/super/root
	+ child/sub/derived
	+ is-a relationship
	+ multiple inheritance not possible - a child class cannot have more than a single parent class
+ Object Substitution
+ polymorphism
	+ compile time polymorphism - overloading (.java -> .class) 
	+ run time polymorphism - overriding (.class -> executing)
	
Rule for Constructor
+ this() or super() must be a first statement in a constructor
+ if we don't have cons call explicitly compiler insert super()
