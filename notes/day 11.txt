IO - Input/Output
+ Prior to 1.4 package java.io - Blocking IO 
+ 1.4 - package java.nio - Non-Blocking IO 
+ Scanner 
	- class to read inputs from console & write outputs to console  
	- java.util
+ Blocking IO 
	- When a file is being read/written
		+ JVM tries to read the file from filesystem/socket(D://file.txt)
		+ Runs in a thread called Main
		+ if file.txt is being used, main thread need to wait
+ Non-Blocking IO 
	- When a file is being read/written
		+ JVM tries to read the file from filesystem/socket(D://file.txt)
		+ Runs in a thread called Main
		+ if file.txt is being used, main thread need not wait
		+ when file is available for use, thread will be notified 
+ InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer
+ Stream - (non-textual files)
	- read/write data from/to a filesystem/socket
	- read byte by byte 
	- ex: image
+ Reader,Writer 
	- read/write data from/to a filesystem/socket
	- reads char by char 
	- ex: textual
+ All IO Exceptions are checked exception
+ Non-Blocking IO - Buffer Oriented 
		+ Channel - gateway/ medium to transfer data  
		+ Buffer
		+ Selector - multiple channels using a single thread. Less threads to handle the channels.
	+ Two-way data transfer - java program to data source and viceversa
	
+ Serialization vs Deserialization
