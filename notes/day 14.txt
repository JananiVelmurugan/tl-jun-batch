Pre requisites
+ interfaces 
+ anonymous inner class 

java 8
+ lambda expression 
+ functional interfaces
+ method references
+ stream 

Streams
+ Why?
	+ functional programming languages uses declarative style 
	+ creates a pipeline of data
	+ it's not array,collection,data structure
	+ it is equivalent to for/iterator 
	+ declarative programming style - concise control flow  
+ What was there before stream?
	+ imperative programming style - detailed control flow  of computational logic 
+ Does it improve performance?
	+ parallel stream - fork join pool (internal multi threading) 
+ Threading 
	> complex computational logic
	> improves the performance wrt to time and efficient use of memory
	> random order
Usecase 
+ huge amount of data ex: 1 lac numbers and find the max 
	+ parallel stream 
	+ for/Iterator
	+ stream - sequential 
	
Two type of operations in streams  
+ Itermediate operations
+ Terminal operations 

Rules
+ when you call a terminal method, the stream will be closed 
+ Until we call a terminal method on streams, none of the intermediate method will be called 
+ Cannot reuse the stream
+ stream are by default sequential  

short-circuit operation
(a>b && c>d) => if a>b returns false, the rest of the operation is short-circuit 
(a>b || c>d) => if a>b returns true, the rest of the operation is short-ciruit 

short-circuting operation - infinite streams
intermediate 
	+ limit()  
terminal 
	+ findFirst()
	+ findAny()
	+ anyMatch()
	+ allMatch()
	+ noneMatch()

Creating infinite streams 
+ iterate()
+ generate() 

Date Time 
Executor
PECS

Sort - Helper Class 
+ Arrays.sort() - quickSort()
+ Collections.sort() - mergeSort()/timSort()
+ sort() cannot be overriden since they are static methods

Comparator
Ex: AgeComparator, SalaryComparator 

reversedOrder() 

Map sorting based on key 
+ entrySet() - <key,Values>
+ keySet() - Key
+ TreeMap 

Collections vs Streams 
+ DS || Not DS 
+ Can be reused || Cannot be reused (IllegalStateException) 

Terminal Operation - collect(Collectors)

Auto Boxing & Unboxing  
converting primitive to objects & vice-versa

comparing(General) vs comparingInt(Specific type)
+ comparing - will unnecessary boxing/autoboxing 
+ comparingInt - no type conversion(to avoid)

algoithm in jdk 7 -> fork join pool
parallel streams - internal fork join pool 

pool - group 
thread pool - pool of threads
multi threading - spawn threads manually 
share the task among the threads spawned by the fork join pool 

fork join pool algo 
1. initialize a threshold
2. if threshold <= number of sub task 
	do task 
  else divide the task until it reaches the threshold 
Ex: 
20 
1. threshold = 5 
2. 10 + 10 =>  5+5 , 5+5
	> thread will be assigned the task and it will execute the task

work stealing algo 
+ 	 threshold = 5 
+ 10 + 10 =>  5+5 , 5+5
	> thread will be assigned the task and it will execute the 
	> if any of the thread is overloaded or idle, the task will be stolen 
	and executed by the thread available
